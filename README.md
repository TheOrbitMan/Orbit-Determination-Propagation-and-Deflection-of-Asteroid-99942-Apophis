# Orbit-Determination-Propagation-and-Deflection-of-Asteroid-99942-Apophis

I'm wondering the following questions:
1)How one can increase accuracy of the orbit determination, What the accuracy depends on?
2)I did not check the orbit determination algorithm for other asteroid cases. Does it still produce reasonable results?
3)In the orbit deflection, I used a simple numerical approach. Does it yield compatible results with the analytical deflection methods? 
5)Why the initial state determined from the orbit determination gives different deflection plots compared to state vector taken from NASA JPL HORIZONS?
6)Why is the N direction such a behaviour on the deflection plot?  

Conference paper: AIAC-2019-070.pdf

*In the conference paper, I made a mistake in the orbit propagation part and indeed orbit deflection part. Therefore results of orbit
propagation and deflection parts are wrong in the paper. But they are corrected in the code.
 
I would be appreciate for any suggestions, opinions, feedbacks through the "Discussions" tab.
